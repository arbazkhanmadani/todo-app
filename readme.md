1. **Setting Up a Node.js Project**:

Before diving into the details, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up a new Node.js project:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new folder for your project (e.g.,Todo_List).
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd  Todo_List
4. Initialize a new Node.js project:
npm init
This will create a package.json file that holds project metadata and dependencies.

2. **Setting Up a React+Vite Project**:

1:- Install Node.js and npm:  If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will also install npm, which is needed to manage packages for your project.

2:- Create a new directory for your project:  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project, and create a new folder for your React + Vite app.

    ```bash
    mkdir todo-list
    ```

3:- Navigate into your project directory:  Use the `cd` command to change into your newly created project directory.

    ```bash
    cd todo-list
    ```

4:- Initialize a new npm project:  Run the following command to initialize a new npm project. This will create a `package.json` file which will contain metadata about your project and its dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

5:-  Install Vite and React: Install Vite and React as dependencies for your project.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev vite
    npm install react react-dom
    ```

6:- Create a Vite project: Use Vite's create command to scaffold a new React project.

    ```bash
    npx create-vite@latest react-vite-project --template react
    ```

    Replace `react-vite-project` with your desired project name.

7:- Navigate into your project directory:  Use the `cd` command to change into your project directory.

    ```bash
    cd react-vite-project
    ```

8:- Start the development server:  Run the following command to start the Vite development server.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the development server and open your default web browser to display your React app. You can now begin developing your React + Vite app!

That's it! You've successfully set up a React project with Vite. You can now start building your React components and writing your application logic using the modern tooling provided by Vite.
